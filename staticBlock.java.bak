/*Example6 ---> Whenever static blocks are part of single the class loader will be responsible to load the static member of respective blocks ,however if ther is more than one class within a java program the jvm will never load all static members of all the classes.Only when the jvm is clear as well as aware to call other class member only then an exceplitly call will be given to class loader to load the static members in the memory.

/*Example4 ---> static blocks are executed only once during the class loading time. Nonstatic and constructor blocks execution is based on new keyword or object creation.

/*Example3 ---> static and non static block are combine.

/*Example2 ---> we can create one or multiple static blocks. the order of execution of the blocks are top to bottom.

	static

	}
}*/

/* Example1 ---> Q.when exactly static blocks are executed?
-----> during class loader time.Class loader is in built method or prefined class to execute static blocks,there is no need for object creation.
Static blocks-----> static
